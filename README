      oregano - An electrical engineering tool for GNOME

oregano is an application for schematic capture and simulation of
electronic circuits. The actual simulation is performed by Berkeley
Spice, or GNUcap or the new generation ngspice.

oregano is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL included in the
file COPYING.

You need libgnome2, libglade2, libgnomeui2, libgtksourceview1.0
and libxml2 to run oregano. 
They can be found at ftp.gnome.org or mirrors. 
To have an executable running you mey either:
1) do 'scons install' 
2) do 'sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install'Å“

oregano still lacks many features. If you want to help out, please
send an email to the project.
